# Template files
Template files go in the templates folder. For a good structure and overview of the files use a sub folder structure

- block (Speaks for itself)
- content (Node files, taxonomy term files)
- field (Field files)
- form (Everything form related)
- layout (Files that have an impact on the global layout such as html.tpl.php, page.tpl.php, region.tpl.php)
- misc (Files you cannot really add in any of the other folders)
- navigation (No explanation need)
- user (Everything user / profile related)
- view (All view related files)
