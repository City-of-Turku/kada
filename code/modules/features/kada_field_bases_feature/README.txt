This file describes the feature, from developer to developer. It should focus on why something has been implemented instead of how, but some tricky or special implementations should be mentioned here. Especially if they cannot be documented in code.

== PURPOSE ==
All field base configurations which don't belong to other feature. Most content types should share fields when possible, but it's possible also that some field is exclusively for one content type, then it's ok to include it in that feature.

== CUSTOM CODE ==
None.
