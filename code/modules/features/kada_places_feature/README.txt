This file describes the feature, from developer to developer. It should focus on why something has been implemented instead of how, but some tricky or special implementations should be mentioned here. Especially if they cannot be documented in code.

== PURPOSE ==
Places are physical locations which offer for example services.

== CONTEXT ==
- place: Displays Services of the Place. Displays links for managing service offers per place.

== CUSTOM CODE ==
- kada_places_features.module:
  - kada_places_feature_form_alter(): Changes to the place node form.

== FIELD INSTANCES ==
- field_description: Describes the place, field translation enabled.
- field_location: Stores coordinates for a place and provides a map widget for inputting the coordinates. No connection to address fields yet, because we need to figure out which are required by the JHS183 and make them translatable.
- field_service_offer: Relation to a service offer for easier editing of relations from place edit form.
- field_accessibility: Field collection with term reference and description.
- field_availability: Opening hours.
- field_address_billing: Text area
- field_address_postal: Address field
- field_address_street: Address field
- field_address_visiting: Address field
- field_description
- field_email
- field_fax_number
- field_person_responsible
- field_phone
- field_phone_switch
- field_website_et
