Page field for referencing pages per entity translation. Relation doesn't work here, because relation always has the same entity endpoint, but chaning the page nid updates the same relation. Entity translation simply stores the nid per translation to the field value.

Replaced core's title with title field.
Context for Service description content type, for displaying Places where the Service is offered.

* 2015-03-11 *
