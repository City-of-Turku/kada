This file describes the feature, from developer to developer. It should focus on why something has been implemented instead of how, but some tricky or special implementations should be mentioned here. Especially if they cannot be documented in code.

== PURPOSE ==
Enhances front-end performance using AdvAgg and image optimization.

== ENABLING ==
Enabling the feature creates folders in "files" folder that might have insufficient permissions,
fix the permissions. Otherwise all the styles on the page are broken.
